# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
This project is a simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game designed to provide an interactive and fun way to play against the computer.  

I built this project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript while improving my front-end development skills. It also helped me better understand user interaction, game state management, and responsive design.  

Players can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer will randomly generate a choice. The scoreboard updates in real-time, and the game announces a winner after a best-of-three series.  

## Key Features
- Interactive game logic with instant feedback.
- Best-of-three scoring system.
- Dynamic display of player and computer choices.
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- Simple, clean, and intuitive UI.  

## How to View
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Click on a gesture (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to start playing against the computer.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Lessons Learned
- Implementing DOM manipulation and event listeners.
- Handling game state and dynamic updates to the UI.
- Building responsive layouts and ensuring cross-device usability.
- Structuring code for readability and maintainability.
